File Types What you may know as a file is slightly different in Python.In Windows, for example, a file can be any item manipulated, edited or created by the user/OS. That means files can be images, text documents, executables, and much more. Most files are organized by keeping them in individual folders. In Python, a file is categorized as either text or binary, and the difference between the two file types is important. Text files are structured as a sequence of lines, where each line includes a sequence of characters. This is what you know as code or syntax. Each line is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line character. There are several types, but the most common is the comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. A backslash character can also be used, and it tells the interpreter that the next character following the slash should be treated as a new line. This character is useful when you dont want to start a new line in the text itself but in the code. A binary file is any type of file that is not a text file. Because of their nature, binary files can only be processed by an application that know or understand the files structure. In other words, they must be applications that can read and interpret binary.In order to open a file for writing or use in Python, you must rely on the built-in open function. As explained above, open will return a file object, so it is most commonly used with two arguments.  An argument is nothing more than a value that has been provided to a function, which is relayed when you call it. So, for instance, if we declare the name of a file as Test File that name would be considered an argument.
