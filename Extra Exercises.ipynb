    " From Wikipedia - The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n",
    " So the tasks are:\n",
    "  * Choose a number n and print its sequence.\n",
    "  * Find a starting number, under ten thousand will create the longest chain (tip: need to count all the number for each sequence.).\n",

A telephone book is a sorted list of people's names, addresses, and telephone numbers. Knowing someone's name allows one to quickly find their telephone number and address.\n",
